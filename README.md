This is a basic aim trainer I made. Use mouse keys to cut green balls. Cut blue balls to get special. Cut purple ball to spawn platform in bottom center. Cut orange ball to increase fire rate of shooter. Cut green ball to get health.

Right-click on mouse to use special (cut all non-red and non-blue balls on screen).
Use left and right arrow keys to control platform. (The platform bounces upto 10 balls upwards.)
Use up, down, left, and right arrow keys to control shooter.

Game ends when health goes to zero, or you cut a red ball. 
Start out with 10 health. Every time a non-red ball falls off-screen you lose health. 
Difficulty increases as score increases.
